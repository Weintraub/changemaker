							<h1>Lessons and Levers of Change</h1>
							<p>The same groups and organizations who are involved in the three largest solution categories. The government has played a crucial role in allocating funding to the right areas and implementing regulations to prevent further damage. Indigenous communities such as the Kwikwetlem First Nations have advocated for the protection of salmon and their habitat through projects and protests.</p>

							<h3>Market Gaps</h3>
							<p>The first gap is that some of the areas the solutions landscape focuses on are not the same as those that were found to be the main causes of the issue. The solutions landscape focuses on habitat destruction, water pollution, and unsustainable fishing, whereas the problem landscape focuses on overfishing and fish farming.</p>
							<p>The second gap we identified is the lack of consultation and acknowledgment from the government to the First Nations peoples. First Nations are greatly affected by the dwindling salmon populations, and their firsthand insight is invaluable in terms of identifying and correcting issues associated with salmon populations in the area, while meeting social and environmental concerns.</p>

							<h3>Market Opportunity & Responsibility</h3>
							<p>There is a large market gap for environmentally sustainable fisheries, specifically in British Columbia. Since society if quickly pivoting to both value and comprehend the importance of sustainability in consumption as well as in business, there is a very large market potential for companies who can achieve this. The future of the fishing industry is B Corps and other sustainable fishing companies.</p>
							<p>There is also an opportunity for the government to be more strict in terms of regulations placed on the fishing industry. An actionable response by the government would be to implement a tariff on fishing past a certain volume, thus discouraging overfishing. A reasonable, yet effective volume level can be decided by utilizing the extensive research conducted through observing the salmon population numbers.</p>
